# data_binify
Binify is a small utility which produces binary files from text descriptions.

The original is still on sourceforge from 2003, Ben introduced me to whilst we worked together at Just Add Monsters many years ago. I've always liked it and have kept a derivative in my tool set.
This new version has several features include
* 64 bit support
* variables
* latest version of yacc/bison
